# Test programs
These programs are used to make sure the emulator works correctly. They have to be assembled before loading into the emulator.

I recommend using Gustavla's [DCPU-16 assembler](https://github.com/gustavla/dcpu16) as it produces output consistent with other assemblers using the v1.7 specification.
